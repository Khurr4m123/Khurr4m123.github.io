For those of you who want to learn or are interested in japanese culture, learning a new language can be a productive goal. Learning a new language has been associated with neurogenesis (brain growth) and increases confidence. It can even provide opportunities for working in Japan. Why not research taking the Japanese language proficiency test. (JLPT)

For those of you who don't know what the JLPT, it's a test taken by over 1 million japanese learners internationally, providing certification for your japanese reading and listening skills. (Writing and speaking are excluded) It's a test taken at many locations, split into 5 tiers of difficulty. N5 is the easiest test and is described on the official JLPT through this statement: "One is able to read and understand typical expressions and sentences written in hiragana, katakana, and basic kanji." On the other hand N1 involves near proficient japanese skills: "One is able to read writings with logical complexity and/or abstract writings on a variety of topics, such as newspaper editorials and critiques, and comprehend both their structures and contents."
