About 30 years ago learning a foreign language would be restricted to finding the best textbooks and language schools. Yet today, the development of the internet has led to an inevitable increase in  language resources available. As of 2020, popular online resources range from platforms such as duolingo, to articles which try to distinguish differences between articles が and は. Many learners combine this with flashcards and textbooks. Each resource claims to be the best, but time is limited. Considering its impossible to fit all of these in your day, which ones should you choose?
The quick answer is that you should choose resources which adhere to your learning style. This is especially true if you are a beginner learning say hiragana or katakana. Resources which you find engaging, and which are giving you results will be among the better resources. However, there are a few things to  keep in mind. Firstly, you should avoid spending your hours trying to find the ‘best’ resource. Stick with one and follow it through if you are seeing results. Secondly, most online resources tend to be quite passive in its teaching style, and hence are limited to gains reading and listening abilities.

These passive skills should not underestimated though, as they still provide an essential building block towards understanding they structure language. Reading is a very useful skill, and elementary reading skills is often a prerequisite to speaking. Reading can be divided into knowledge of the syllabary (e.g. Kanji, hiragana and katakana), grammar and vocabulary. It can also be the goal of some language learners - such as being able to reading manga or Japanese novels.  

The issue comes with the acquisition of active skills, namely speaking and writing.  These usually can’t be mastered through online resources alone. This obviously excludes websites which pair you to native speakers such as [italki](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjhkqmSparsAhUKURUIHQFuD80QFjAAegQIERAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.italki.com%2F%3Fhl%3Den&usg=AOvVaw2mSi4mgqatkk6pxLG3et7-).

Nevertheless, let’s compare some of the most popular types of resources that I’ve had the chance to use:

*	Remembering the Kanji (RTK) by James Heisig

This was the first resource I used beyond hiragana and katakana. It’s a textbook which essentially  tries to teach you the main 2200 or so most common kanji. It both does this and doesn’t do this. More specifically, it teaches you how to differentiate between the kanji, and creates mnemonics to help. This usually takes a few months to a year to complete. The biggest advantage is the short amount of time taken to ‘learn’ 2200 kanji. The drawback is that you still can’t read any words. Nevertheless, it drastically shortness the time required too learn words. 

*	Wanikani 

This is a popular paid subscription which essentially does what RTK does, but also teaches you the readings of the words, and some vocabulary (~6000 words). It’s advantage is that it forces you type in some answers and is hence a more active approach. 

*	Memrise

Memrise is a website and app which provides access to user created courses which ficus on grammar and vocab memorisation. 

*	Android/IOS Apps 

Some mobile applications are very useful in providing some basic Japanese content. This ranges from electronic dictionaries, to grammar courses. These are definitely worth checking out. However, I am yet to find an app which can be used as a main resource. In my opinion, mobile applications  are a good supplement.

*	Textbooks 

A traditional type of resource which is still important today. You can get away with not using textbooks, but is a way to introduce structure, and ensure you are not missing out anything vital. One of best beginner textbooks include Genki I & II. Completing these will get you to a lower intermediate stage. 

*	Anki 

The most important resource on this list for vocabulary acquisition. It is an SRS application which uses science to optimise our ability to learn or memorise information split into small chunks . The word anki (暗記) literally means memorisation, and if used correctly, is a way to learn almost anything. You can create your own deck and craete cards based on words you’ve come across. For example, If you learn a new word through immersion, you can create a new flashcard. You also have access to premade decks.

*	Duolingo 

Ill get straight to the point and say that this one of the worst resources that I used. Although it’s free and provides some motivation with its ranking system, it’s filled with errors, and it doesn’t really teach you anything besides basic sentence structure.

*	Lingodeer

A better alternative to duolingo is a mobile application called lingodeer. It has a one of cost but gives you a good into basic grammar and sentence structure. It also includes some basic exposure to kanji and by the end, you’ll be ready to tackle more upper-beginner learning resources.

If you’ve already spent over 1000 hours learning, resources such as those listed above should begin to become supplements. I’d suggest veering away from resources which are focused at teaching you Japanese, and towards actual Japanese content. This is called immersion. You can start by finding an easy Japanese book to read, or listening to basic Japanese podcasts.
