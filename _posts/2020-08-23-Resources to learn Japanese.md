With the internet comes a wealth of resources. From duolingo to classic Japanese textbooks to articles describing the differences between articles が and は, and flashcard applications like Memrise or Anki. Considering its impossible to fit all of these in your day, which ones should you choose?

The obvious answer is whatever works for you, but there are a few things to keep in mind. Grinding all of these applications will not teach you Japanese. But you need to first define what it means for you to have learned Japanese.  Usually it involves reading, listening, writing and of course speaking. Resources can help you the passive skills - reading and listen, but  active skills involving language production - writing and speaking, can’t be mastered through online resources alone. 

Reading is a very useful skill, and elementary reading skills is often a prerequisite to speaking. Reading comprises of Kanji, grammar and vocabulary, but the hardest part is combining both. Let’s list the main resources learners use to supplement learning these:

**Kanji**
*	Remembering the Kanji (RTK)
*	Wanikani
*	Kanji Textbook 

**Vocabulary**
*	Anki or memrise (recommended)
*	Android/IOS Apps (e.g. Kanji study) 
*	Vocabulary textbooks (wouldn’t recommend)

**Grammar**
*	SRS application: Anki 
*	Grammar Textbook (recommended)

**Combined**
*	Duolingo or lingodeer
*	Immersion

At the end of the day, resources such as those listed above are just supplements. If you have already been using these kinds of resources for a while now, I’d suggest attempting to read an easy Japanese book or listen to a podcast.
