For those of you who don’t know what the JLPT is, it’s a language test taken by over 1 million Japanese learners internationally! It provides valuable certification testing your reading and listening abilities. Its also the easiest way to prove to your employees that you’ve actually dedicated hundreds or thousands of hours learning Japanese. Ive heard of employers who have rejected people who can  speak Japanese on the basis that they hadn’t got a JLPT certification! What’s also funny is that in the exams  speaking and writing are completely excluded, so you can pass the N1 test without being able to speak a word - although this route isn’t recommended! It’s a test that can be taken at many locations worldwide, and is famously split into 5 tiers of difficulty. 
Level N5 is the easiest test and as described on the official JLPT through this statement: “One is able to read and understand typical expressions and sentences written in hiragana, katakana, and basic kanji.” On the other hand N1 involves near proficient Japanese skills: “One is able to read writings with logical complexity and/or abstract writings on a variety of topics, such as newspaper editorials and critiques, and comprehend both their structures and contents.”
If you’re considering taking the test its worth noting the cost is £100 in England with similar values for other countries, and the pass rate is often under 50%...Nevertheless, even if you fail the first time, it’s still a fun experience.
