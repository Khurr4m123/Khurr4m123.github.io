Here is a brief look at some of the most popuar Japanese textbooks I have used: 

**N5 Novice**
* Genki I: 
Must have resource 

**N4 Beginner**
* Genki II: 
A must have supplement to the first Genki book. Typically used in Japanese taught classes, as it inlcudes individual exercises and group speaking exercises. I would also recommend the grammar textbook.

**N3 Lower intermediate** 
* Tobira: 
A brilliant all in one textbook which is written mostly in Japanese. It includes long reading and listening sections, but they are often interesting. the only downside is the grammar is a little disorganised. 
* Soumatome series: 
I wouldnt recommend the grammar book from the series.
* Shinkanzen master series: 
A little more grindy than the Soumatome series, as it's tailored towards the JLPT exam. The grammar textbook is the most important.

**N2 Upper intermediate**
* Shinkanzen master series: 
Must have for the JLPT N2 upwards. Grammar is essential. You could do without vocabulary and kanji textbooks. Just be prepared for a Japanese only experience and a digital dictionary!

**N1 Advanced** 
* Shinkanzen master series
